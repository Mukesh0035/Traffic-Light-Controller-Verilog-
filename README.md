# Traffic-Light-Controller-Verilog-
Traffic Light Controller (Verilog) â€” A finite state machine (FSM)-based traffic light system for a two-way intersection, designed in Verilog. Includes integrated timer logic to control light durations (green, yellow, red) for both directions. Ideal for learning FSM design, timing, and digital control systems.
